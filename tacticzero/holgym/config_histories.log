48438027 bootstrap pred_set error due to "T" occurring in replays, which is due to another bug that when a proof check fails we reset the history using T. Such a proof check failure occurs due to double proof translation error.

another failure occurs when a proof works when simpset is removed, but breaks when the simpset is recovered. This is fixed when we fix both the proof translation error and removing simpset during validation
